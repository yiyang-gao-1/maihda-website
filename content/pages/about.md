# About the MAIHDA Resource Hub

The **MAIHDA Resource Hub** is an open platform designed for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in the **Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA)** methodology.  

Our aim is to make MAIHDA accessible for both **beginners** (who may never have encountered multilevel models) and **advanced users** (who want to track new developments and applications).

## The Project

This hub complements the [MAIHDA ESRC Project Website](https://intersectionalhealth.org/projects/esrc-maihda-project/), by providing:

- An **updated paper repository** (with automated discovery of new research)
- **Learning materials** for newcomers
- **Case studies and applications** across health, education, and beyond
- Integration with interactive **Shiny apps** and data tools
